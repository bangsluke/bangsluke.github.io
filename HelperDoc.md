### Decide on Architecture

If it is just a web app to be built, consider the below Front End, Back End and Database Architecture options. If it also needs to be a mobile app, consider the below Mobile Architecture options.

#### Front End Architecture

- Considerations:
  - Single page application or not?
  - SSR (Server side rendering) or SSG (Static site generation) required?
- Options:
  - CRA (Create React App)
  - Vite
  - NextJS

#### Back End Architecture

- Considerations:
  - Need to investigate

- Options:
  - ExpressJS
  - NodeJS

#### Database

- Considerations:
  - Should it be SQL or non SQL?
  - How am I going to query my database? Via a client? By the CLI?
  - Consider TypeORM or Prisma for type safe access to your database
- Options:
  - Sequel DBs:
    - Xata
    - MySQL
    - Postgress (recommended)
  - No Sequel DBs:
    - Firebase

### Initiate a Git Repository and link to ![GitHub Logo](https://i.imgur.com/zD0C9oF.png) GitHub

- Create a new repository on GitHub
- In the app terminal, initiate git and push to GitHub (replace the below GitHub URL with your own);

```powershell
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/bangsluke/hacker-stories.git
git branch -M main
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

- Make the repo private or public based on the requirements
- Protect the main branch from being pushed to directly
- Create a develop branch
- Add a .gitignore file to the root of the project

> [^ Back To Top](#table-of-contents)

### Folder and File Structure

#### Folder Structure

- Create a folder structure that makes sense for the project
  - For a React project, have the following set up
  > Note, this structure is based off of the [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) project

```n/a
src
|
+-- /assets            # Assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
+-- /components        # Shared components used across the entire application
+-- /config            # All the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
+---- .env             # Environment variables
+-- /data              # Any stored data that is used across the application (my own addition)
+-- /features          # Feature based modules
+-- /hooks             # Shared hooks used across the entire application
+-- /lib               # Re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
+-- /providers         # All of the application providers
+-- /routes            # Routes configuration
+-- /stores            # Global state stores
+-- /test              # Test utilities and mock server
+-- /types             # Base types used across the application
+-- /utils             # Shared utility functions
```

  - For a Next project, consider which folders are not needed, e.g. Routes would not be needed as Next handles routing via the pages folder
  - To set up the above structure, first, navigate to the root folder of your project and then run the command from the linked file in the terminal
    - [Folder Structure Command.md](https://github.com/bangsluke/bangsluke.github.io/blob/main/FolderStructureCommand.md)

> [^ Back To Top](#table-of-contents)

#### File Set Up

- Also, it is best practice to have a certain few files within your project

> Note, these files are already created in the above command

  - README.md file in the root of the project
    `echo "# Project" > README.md`
  - An empty .env file in the root of the project

    ```powershell
    echo "# Add an API Key" > .env
    echo "API_KEY=AddKey" >> .env
    ```

  - .gitignore file in the root of the project

    ```powershell
    echo "# local env files" > .gitignore
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

    - [Gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) is a great resource to generate a .gitignore file for your project

### ![ESLint Logo](https://i.imgur.com/ebsMde1.png) ESLint and ![Prettier Logo](https://i.imgur.com/IJ3Ksm0.png) Prettier Config

- Copy over the .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc set ups from a good project (e.g. Dorkinians Mobile Stats)
- Make changes if any are required
- Consider the below references if needed

> [^ Back To Top](#table-of-contents)

### .env Files and Variables

- To securely store environment variables, create a .env file in the root of the project
- Then create a .gitignore file in the root of the project and add the .env file to it
- For CRA, you can create .env variables named as `REACT_APP_` and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY`
  - [See this article](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)
- For Vite, you can create .env variables named as `VITE_` and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `VITE_API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`
  - [See this article](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files)
- For Next.JS;
  - Example: `API_KEY=1234567890`
  - If you're just working in Node.JS, you can then use the variable in the code as `process.env.API_KEY`
  - If you're working in the browser, you have to prefix the variable in the code as `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
  - [See this article](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)

## Project Release Checklist

Use this checklist tool for each site released - [frontendchecklist.io](https://frontendchecklist.io/)

### SEO and Meta Data

- This will depend on the project and its requirements and if it needs to be SEO friendly (private projects may not need this)
- Set up meta tags in the index.html file
  - [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/)
  - [The Power of Metadata in Next.js 13 (Part 2): Optimize Your Website’s SEO NOW!](https://medium.com/@danielcracbusiness/the-power-of-metadata-in-next-js-13-part-2-optimize-your-websites-seo-now-d822c82ba920)

### 404 Page

- Create a 404 page for catching routing errors
  - [error404.fun](https://error404.fun/)
  - Add simple JavaScript back function to a back button (see Big Lynn error page for example)
- Consider if additional 404 pages are required for other errors, such as 500, 503, etc.

## Framework Specific Checks

- If using Next.js
  - [Advanced Next JS Concepts](https://blog.devgenius.io/advanced-next-js-concepts-8439a8752597)
  - Make sure to optimize images using next/image. e.g.

    ```javascript
    import Image from 'next/image'
    <Image
        src="/images/my-image.jpg"
        alt="My Image"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        loading="lazy"
      />
    ```

  - Add Next.js Analytics (see section 4.d of the above article)
    - <https://nextjs.org/analytics>

### Other General Tests

- Check that if you have a fixed header, the page scrolls to the correct position when clicking on a link - (<https://calvinke.com/seo/fixed-header-anchor-css/>)
- Check that the site works on all devices and browsers - [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)

## ![Git Logo](https://i.imgur.com/2xve41Z.png) Git Fixes

### Error: Unable to load Commits. fatal: bad object desktop.ini

Summary: Bad desktop.ini file that is created by Google Drive. Needs to be deleted.

#### Delete all desktop.ini files

1. Run CMD as administrator
2. Navigate to the folder where the bad file is using `cd`
3. Delete all "desktop.ini" files in the folder and all sub-folders using `del desktop.ini /A:H /S`
4. Reload the git graph extension and the error should have gone

#### Manually delete each desktop.ini file with explanations

1. Run CMD as administrator
2. Navigate to the folder where the bad file is using `cd`
3. Show all files in the folder along with their marked attributes using `attrib`
4. Any hidden file has an "H" file attribute next to it
5. Remove the hidden attribute of the file using `attrib -h desktop.ini`. Note, if there are more than one attribute, you need to remove all of them for this command to work (see link 3)
6. Delete the file using `del desktop.ini`
7. Continue for all files that need to be deleted
8. Reload the git graph extension and the error should have gone

### Clearing Secrets from History

Summary:

- Create a text file at the parent folder of the repo (not in the repo) of the replacements you need to make such as "BigLynnReplacements.txt"
- Each line is a new replacement, e.g.;
	`‘xau_8Q9v6YrRzXgPcSvgjOvVbYEwkKm1lgBo4’==>ENV[‘XATA_API_KEY’]` would replace the API key with the environment variable name
- Copy the file "git-filter-repo" from Personal Coding into the repo
- Open the CMD for the repo
- Use the command `git filter-repo --replace-text ../BigLynnReplacements.txt --force` to go through the history of the repo and make all the required replacements
