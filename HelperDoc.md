## Git Fixes

### Error: Unable to load Commits. fatal: bad object desktop.ini

Summary: Bad desktop.ini file that is created by Google Drive. Needs to be deleted.

#### Delete all desktop.ini files

1. Run CMD as administrator
2. Navigate to the folder where the bad file is using `cd`
3. Delete all "desktop.ini" files in the folder and all sub-folders using `del desktop.ini /A:H /S`
4. Reload the git graph extension and the error should have gone

#### Manually delete each desktop.ini file with explanations

1. Run CMD as administrator
2. Navigate to the folder where the bad file is using `cd`
3. Show all files in the folder along with their marked attributes using `attrib`
4. Any hidden file has an "H" file attribute next to it
5. Remove the hidden attribute of the file using `attrib -h desktop.ini`. Note, if there are more than one attribute, you need to remove all of them for this command to work (see link 3)
6. Delete the file using `del desktop.ini`
7. Continue for all files that need to be deleted
8. Reload the git graph extension and the error should have gone

### Clearing Secrets from History

Summary:

- Create a text file at the parent folder of the repo (not in the repo) of the replacements you need to make such as "BigLynnReplacements.txt"
- Each line is a new replacement, e.g.;
	`‘xau_8Q9v6YrRzXgPcSvgjOvVbYEwkKm1lgBo4’==>ENV[‘XATA_API_KEY’]` would replace the API key with the environment variable name
- Copy the file "git-filter-repo" from Personal Coding into the repo
- Open the CMD for the repo
- Use the command `git filter-repo --replace-text ../BigLynnReplacements.txt --force` to go through the history of the repo and make all the required replacements
