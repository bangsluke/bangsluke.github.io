#### Back End Architecture

- Considerations:
  - Need to investigate
- Options:
  - ExpressJS

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/bangsluke/hacker-stories.git
git branch -M main
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```
- Make the repo private or public based on the requirements
- Protect the main branch from being pushed to directly
- Create a develop branch
- Add a .gitignore file to the root of the project

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/ebsMde1.png) ESLint and ![](https://i.imgur.com/IJ3Ksm0.png) Prettier Config

- Copy over the .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc set ups from a good project (e.g. Dorkinians Mobile Stats)
- Make changes if any are required
- Consider the below references if needed

### .env Files and Variables

- To securely store environment variables, create a .env file in the root of the project
- Then create a .gitignore file in the root of the project and add the .env file to it
- For CRA, you can create .env variables named as `REACT_APP_` and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY`
  - [See this article](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)
- For Vite, you can create .env variables named as `VITE_` and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `VITE_API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`
  - [See this article](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files)
- For Next.JS, you can create .env variables with any name (no prefix needed) and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `process.env.API_KEY`
  - [See this article](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)

## ![](https://i.imgur.com/2xve41Z.png)  Git Fixes

### Error: Unable to load Commits. fatal: bad object desktop.ini

Summary: Bad desktop.ini file that is created by Google Drive. Needs to be deleted.

#### Delete all desktop.ini files

1. Run CMD as administrator
2. Navigate to the folder where the bad file is using `cd`
3. Delete all "desktop.ini" files in the folder and all sub-folders using `del desktop.ini /A:H /S`
4. Reload the git graph extension and the error should have gone

#### Manually delete each desktop.ini file with explanations

1. Run CMD as administrator
2. Navigate to the folder where the bad file is using `cd`
3. Show all files in the folder along with their marked attributes using `attrib`
4. Any hidden file has an "H" file attribute next to it
5. Remove the hidden attribute of the file using `attrib -h desktop.ini`. Note, if there are more than one attribute, you need to remove all of them for this command to work (see link 3)
6. Delete the file using `del desktop.ini`
7. Continue for all files that need to be deleted
8. Reload the git graph extension and the error should have gone

### Clearing Secrets from History

Summary:

- Create a text file at the parent folder of the repo (not in the repo) of the replacements you need to make such as "BigLynnReplacements.txt"
- Each line is a new replacement, e.g.;
	`‘xau_8Q9v6YrRzXgPcSvgjOvVbYEwkKm1lgBo4’==>ENV[‘XATA_API_KEY’]` would replace the API key with the environment variable name
- Copy the file "git-filter-repo" from Personal Coding into the repo
- Open the CMD for the repo
- Use the command `git filter-repo --replace-text ../BigLynnReplacements.txt --force` to go through the history of the repo and make all the required replacements
