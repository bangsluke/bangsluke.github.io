			<p>

				--- Change the initial picture to be square for all users.
				--- Remove the details section? Re-use somewhere else?
				--- Fix the mailto: email links.
				- Football
				--- [DONE]. Create a section called football with Prem team and Dorkinians?

				Long Term Ideas
				- Modify the Weather widget to dynamically change to the users location. Use GeoLocation to confirm

				JavaScript code to add and remove attriutes, use jSnapTabs1.js as an example
				(tabnav.querySelector(':scope a[active]').removeAttribute('active') and tabbtn.setAttribute('active',
				'')).
