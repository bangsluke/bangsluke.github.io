				JavaScript code to add and remove attriutes, use jSnapTabs1.js as an example
				(tabnav.querySelector(':scope a[active]').removeAttribute('active') and tabbtn.setAttribute('active',
				'')). https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/ms3m2n/show_user_location_on_google_maps_using_javascript/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
