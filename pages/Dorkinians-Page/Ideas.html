	<h2>Ideas</h2>

	<div>
		<h3>General</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>Short Term To Do</h4>

			<h5>All Tabs</h5>
			<p>
				- Have the team drop down filter the displayed data for the selected team.
				- Consider removing the drop down at the top. Have a single large filter button in the top right that filters all pages. 
				- Draw out ideas and update ideas page
					- Have first Tab “Club Stats”
						- Show total club stats, total recorded goals scored etc.
						- How many members
						- Upcoming fixtures and weather forecast 
					- Second tab “Player Stats”
						- Filterable list
					- Third tab “Comparison”
						- Pick two players
					- Fourth tab “Results, tables and fixtures.
						- Show all teams with each info but put each team info into divs with team name as id and filter out
						- Allow showing tables, fixtures results separately 
				- Test out if you can reuse the filter function twice, like once for 1s team and then again for filtering for a season. 
				- Test out papa parsing each tab data only once, storing that as a global variable and then just doing all filtering/re filtering on that variable to save needing to re parse
				- Have a share to social media button. Update the Meta data of the page in the head section, as described in the SoloLearn Coding for Marketers section.
			</p>

			<h5>Club Stats</h5>
			<p>
				- Show the stats of everyone in the club.
				- Have this filter down to just the shown team when team is selected.
				- Add a control to the site for each player, allowing them to be shown or not shown on the site. If player has a boolean true next to them, allow them to be shown, if not don't. For GDPR reasons, might not be able to show someone unless they've signed membership.
				- TBC

			<h5>Player Stats</h5>
			<p>
				- Update to look like https://footystats.org/players/england/harry-kane.

			<h5>Results, Tables & Fixtures</h5>

			<p>
