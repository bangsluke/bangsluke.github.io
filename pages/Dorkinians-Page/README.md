# Preparing files for main site.

To get the files ready for upload to the main site, do the following actions;

- Go to "index.html" and then run the "Minify" command in VS Code (Shift + Ctrl + M). This will create a file called "index.min.html" with reduced size.
- Do the same for "DorkiniansMain.css", "jDorkiniansMain.js" and other files.
