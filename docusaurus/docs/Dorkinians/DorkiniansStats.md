## To Do List

### Thursday

- Look up the [fixtures from the FA Site](https://fulltime.thefa.com/fixtures.html?league=9031785&selectedSeason=495559713&selectedDivision=921408008&selectedCompetition=0&selectedFixtureGroupKey=1_313360010) for each team and add them to the sheet

### Saturday

- Add results from the Dorkinians group chat or [results from the FA Site](https://fulltime.thefa.com/results.html?league=9031785&selectedSeason=495559713&selectedDivision=921408008&selectedCompetition=0&selectedFixtureGroupKey=1_313360010) to the sheet so that when captains add stats, they have the right number of goals to allocate (can also be Sunday)

### Sunday/Monday

- Chase the captains to complete their [stats](#control-panel) and fix any problems they have
- ⁠Once all captains have done their stats, load the [website](https://www.dorkiniansfcstats.co.uk/#team-of-the-week), screenshot TOTW and post

## Details

### Control Panel

The control panel can be used to monitor that status of each team's stats. If there are any errors on a teams sheet, they will be flagged here.

Each column provides a specific error type to help debug where to look.

## How the stats site works

## Debugging Stats Problems

### Errors

:::info
Each team stat sheet has this detail on the first tab of their document
:::

|Error|Explanation|
|---|---|
|BLANK ERROR|A blank error means that one of the key bits of information for a player is missing (either name, date - match, APP or CLASS). Add the missing detail to clear the error.|
|NAME ERROR|A name error means that the entered player name doesn't exist in the Dorkinians list of players. Try alternative names/spellings if you think this player should exist. If you think this is a new player, please contact your Stats Master to add the name.|
|MOM ERROR|An MoM error means that the current match doesn't have a MoM assigned to it. We prefer to have one. If you definitely don't have one, you can overrule the flagged error on the Games Checker tab.|
|GOALS ERROR|A goals error means that the number of goals listed as being scored by the Dorkinians team on the Games Checker tab doesn't align with the number of goals awarded on the stats. Check the number of goals are correct. If the Games Checker tab is an incorrect scoreline, contact your stats master. If one of the goals Dorkinians scored was an opposition own goal, record that on the Games Checker tab.|
|DUPLICATE NAME ERROR|A duplicate name error means that you have the same player listed twice against a fixture. Check this. If there is definitely not a mistake, you can overrule the flagged error on the Games Checker tab.|

### Adding a Player

To add a player to the Dorkinians database, do the following steps;

- Navigate to the `Players List` tab on the main stats sheet
- Scroll to where to add the player (alphabetical is preferred for long term maintenance) and right click on the row numbers to add a row above or below the current row
- Add the players name
- Add a `TRUE` or `FALSE` value for if they should be shown on the website (can say false to hide players who don't want to be shown)
- Optionally you can add a team (historically I've added the first team the player played for)
- Add a Class
- You can ignore the remaining details - we no longer use them
