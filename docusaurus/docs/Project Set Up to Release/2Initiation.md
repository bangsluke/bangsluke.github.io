## Create the New App

### Boilerplate Code

  - Consider using a boilerplate code to get started, as listed <a href="https://todoist.com/showTask?id=6518989300&sync_id=6518989300" target="_blank">here</a>

### CRA (Create React App)

![React Logo](https://i.imgur.com/LMShXOo.png)

  - `npx create-react-app my-app` - Create a new React app called "my-app"
  - `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript` - Create a new React app called "my-app" with TypeScript
  - `cd my-app` - Change directory to the new React app
  - `npm start` - Start the React app
  - `npm run build` - Build the React app for production

### Vite

![Vite Logo](https://i.imgur.com/smpppHt.png)

  - To use Vite with Yarn and TypeScript do the following;
    - `yarn create vite my-app --template react-ts`
    - Then follow the instructions in the terminal
      - Note: For "package name" use the name of the app
    - For other possible Vite options see <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project" target="_blank">here</a>
  - `cd my-app` - Change directory to the new React app
	- `yarn` - Install the dependencies
	- `yarn dev` - Start the React app
	- `yarn build` - Build the React app for production

### Next.JS

![NextJS Logo](https://i.imgur.com/OGtWPsT.png)

  - JavaScript and npm
	- `npx create-next-app@latest` - Create a new Next.JS app (name will be requested)
	- `cd xxx` - Change directory to the new Next.JS app replacing the xxx with the name of the app
	- `npm install` - Install the dependencies
	- `npm run dev` - Start the React app
	- `npm run build` - Build the React app for production
  - Typescript and yarn
    - `yarn create next-app --typescript` - Create a new Next.JS app with TypeScript (name will be requested)
    - `cd xxx` - Change directory to the new Next.JS app replacing the xxx with the name of the app
  - `yarn` - Install the dependencies
	- `yarn dev` - Start the React app
	- `yarn build` - Build the React app for production

## Initiate a Git Repository and link to GitHub

![GitHub Logo](https://i.imgur.com/zD0C9oF.png)

- Create a new repository on GitHub
- In the app terminal, initiate git and push to GitHub (replace the below GitHub URL with your own);

```powershell
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/bangsluke/hacker-stories.git
git branch -M main
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

- Make the repo private or public based on the requirements
- Protect the main branch from being pushed to directly
- Create a develop branch
- Add a .gitignore file to the root of the project


## Structure and File Setup

### Folder and File Structure

#### Folder Structure

- Create a folder structure that makes sense for the project
  - For a React project, have the following set up
  > Note, this structure is based off of the <a href="https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react" target="_blank">Bulletproof React</a> project

```n/a
src
|
+-- /assets            # Assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
+-- /components        # Shared components used across the entire application
+-- /config            # All the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app
+---- .env             # Environment variables
+-- /data              # Any stored data that is used across the application (my own addition)
+-- /features          # Feature based modules
+-- /hooks             # Shared hooks used across the entire application
+-- /lib               # Re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
+-- /providers         # All of the application providers
+-- /routes            # Routes configuration
+-- /stores            # Global state stores
+-- /test              # Test utilities and mock server
+-- /types             # Base types used across the application
+-- /utils             # Shared utility functions
```

  - For a Next project, consider which folders are not needed, e.g. Routes would not be needed as Next handles routing via the pages folder
  - To set up the above structure, first, navigate to the root folder of your project and then run the command from the linked file in the terminal
    - <a href="https://github.com/bangsluke/bangsluke.github.io/blob/main/FolderStructureCommand.md" target="_blank">Folder Structure Command.md</a>

#### Component Set Up

See point 4 of <a href="https://medium.com/@renanolovics/10-best-practices-in-front-end-development-react-5277a671e2df" target="_blank">10 Best Practices in Front End Development (React)</a>

Structure your components in the following way, using Export Barrelling (point 2);

```n/a
--components:
----Button
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
----Icon
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
----Input
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
```

#### File Set Up

- Also, it is best practice to have a certain few files within your project

> Note, these files are already created in the above command

  - README.md file in the root of the project
    `echo "# Project" > README.md`
  - An empty .env file in the root of the project

    ```powershell
    echo "# Add an API Key" > .env
    echo "API_KEY=AddKey" >> .env
    ```

  - .gitignore file in the root of the project

    ```powershell
    echo "# local env files" > .gitignore
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

    - <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore" target="_blank">Gitignore.io</a> is a great resource to generate a .gitignore file for your project

### .env Files and Variables

- To securely store environment variables, create a .env file in the root of the project
- Then create a .gitignore file in the root of the project and add the .env file to it
- For CRA, you can create .env variables named as `REACT_APP_` and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY`
  - <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/" target="_blank">See this article</a>
- For Vite, you can create .env variables named as `VITE_` and they will be available in the browser
  - Example: `VITE_API_KEY=1234567890`
  - You can then use the variable in the code as `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`
  - <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files" target="_blank">See this article</a>
- For Next.JS;
  - Example: `API_KEY=1234567890`
  - If you're just working in Node.JS, you can then use the variable in the code as `process.env.API_KEY`
  - If you're working in the browser, you have to prefix the variable in the code as `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
  - <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables" target="_blank">See this article</a>

### ESLint and Prettier Config

![ESLint Logo](https://i.imgur.com/ebsMde1.png) ![Prettier Logo](https://i.imgur.com/IJ3Ksm0.png)

- Copy over the .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc set ups from a good project (e.g. Dorkinians Mobile Stats)
- Make changes if any are required
- Consider the below references if needed

### React Set Up

If using React, consider the following links:

## GitHub Workflows

![GitHub Logo](https://i.imgur.com/zD0C9oF.png)

- Create the folder structure .github/workflows at the root folder
- Copy over the workflow .yml files from a good project (e.g. Dorkinians Mobile Stats)
  - CI.yml
  - CD.yml
  - CodeQL.yml
  - dependencyReview.yml
  - dependabot.yml
- Modify any details of the workflow to suit your needs
- Add automated linting to CI/CD
