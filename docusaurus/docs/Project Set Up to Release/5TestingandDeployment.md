- Set up deployment to the hosting service of choice
- Recommend Netlify for a simple deployment
- Set up additional Netlify integrations (e.g. Lighthouse, Checklinks, HTML Validate). Link is [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dorkinians-mobile-stats/integrations) once deployed. (!NOTE - Not yet got these working on a repo)

    - Checklinks - Checklinks helps you keep all your asset references correct and avoid embarrassing broken links to your internal pages, or even to external pages you link out to.
    - HTML Validate - Validate HTML generated by your build.
  - Possible haves
    - Image Optim - Optimize images as part of your Netlify build process.
    - Is Website Vulnerable - A Netlify plugin that uses Snyk to test for security vulnerabilities in a website's JavaScript libraries.
