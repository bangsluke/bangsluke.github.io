## Inspiration

For inspiration for projects, check out the following resources on the `Coding Resources` [Design UI/UX Links Todoist list](https://todoist.com/showTask?id=6132126520&sync_id=6506085362)

## Decide on Architecture

If it is just a web app to be built, consider the below Front End, Back End and Database Architecture options. If it also needs to be a mobile app, consider the below Mobile Architecture options.

### Front End Architecture

- Considerations:
  - Single page application or not?
  - SSR (Server side rendering) or SSG (Static site generation) required?
- Options:
  - CRA (Create React App)
  - Vite
  - NextJS

### Back End Architecture

- Considerations:
  - Need to investigate
  - [Backend development is more than writing endpoints for frontend](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/backend-development-is-more-than-writing-endpoints-for-frontend-gl1)
- Options:
  - ExpressJS
  - NodeJS

### Database

- Considerations:
  - Should it be SQL or non SQL?
  - How am I going to query my database? Via a client? By the CLI?
  - Consider TypeORM or Prisma for type safe access to your database
- Options:
  - Sequel DBs:
    - Xata
    - MySQL
    - Postgress (recommended)
  - No Sequel DBs:
    - Firebase
    - MongoDB
    - PlanetScale
    - Supebase

### Hosting

- Considerations:
  - How much will hosting the site cost?
  - What features does the hosting provide?
  - What access protection does the hosting service offer for limiting access to your app or database?
- Options:
  - Netlify (free)
  - Vercel
  - Heroku (cheap)
  - DigitalOcean (cheap)
  - Amazon RDS (expensive)
  - BlueHost (basic)
