# Code

> [Back to SDLC Intro](../SDLC/introduction)

The **Code** (or Implementation) phase is where the actual software construction takes place. Developers write the code according to the design specifications created in the previous stage.

## The Development Process

This is typically the longest phase of the SDLC.

- **Environment Setup:** Configuring IDEs, compilers, and necessary tools.
- **Coding:** Writing code in the chosen programming languages.
- **Code Review:** Peer reviews to ensure code quality, readability, and adherence to standards.
- **Documentation:** Writing inline comments and documentation for APIs.

### Key Deliverables

- Source Code
- Unit Test Results
- Technical Documentation

:::tip[How AI Can Help: Coding]
AI has transitioned from a simple tool to an intelligent pair programmer:

- **Predictive Coding:** Tools like [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/), [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/), and [JetBrains AI](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/) provide context-aware code completions and can generate entire functions capabilities directly in the IDE.
- **Security Scanning:** Tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/) perform real-time security analysis as code is written, identifying vulnerabilities instantly.
- **Documentation:** AI can automatically generate docstrings and comments, keeping documentation in sync with code changes.
