# Verify

> [Back to SDLC Intro](../SDLC/introduction)

The **Verify** (or Testing) phase ensures that the software is defect-free and meets the requirements defined in the planning phase. It is critical for quality assurance (QA).

## Testing Methodologies

Testing identifies gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements.

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Verifying that different modules work together.
- **System Testing:** Testing the complete and integrated software product.
- **Performance Testing:** Checking speed, responsiveness, and stability under load.
- **Security Testing:** Ensuring the application is secure against threats.

### Key Deliverables

- Test Plans and Test Cases
- Bug Reports
- Test Execution Reports

:::tip[How AI Can Help: Verification]
AI is reimagining verification by automating the most tedious parts of QA:

- **Test Generation:** AI can create comprehensive test suites and edge cases automatically from code. Tools like [SmartBear TestComplete](https://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/) and [Inflectra Rapise](https://www.inflectra.com/Rapise/) use AI to maintain robust test scripts.
- **Static Analysis:** Advanced static analysis tools (e.g., [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)) use AI to identify complex bugs and code smells that traditional rules might miss.
- **Synthetic Data:** Privacy laws often prevent testing with real user data. AI tools like [Delphix](https://www.delphix.com/) can generate comprehensive synthetic datasets that mimic production data without the privacy risks.
