# Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle

> [Back to Documentation Intro Contents](../DocumentationIntro.md)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured methodology used by software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

## The Phases

The classical SDLC typically follows a series of distinct phases. Each phase relies on the information from the previous phase to produce its own deliverables.

1.  **[Planning and Design](./02-planning-and-design.md):** Gathering requirements and architecting the solution.
2.  **[Code](./03-code.md):** The actionable part where developers write the software.
3.  **[Verify](./04-verify.md):** Testing the software to ensure it solves the problem and is bug-free.
4.  **[Integrate](./05-integrate.md):** Combining modules and managing dependencies.
5.  **[Release](./06-release.md):** Packaging and preparing the software for delivery.
6.  **[Deploy](./07-deploy.md):** Moving the software to production environments.
7.  **[Operate](./08-operate.md):** Running the software in the real world.
8.  **[Monitor](./09-monitor.md):** Observing system health and user behavior.

## The Evolution to AI

While the core principles of SDLC remain constant, the tools and methodologies are evolving. Generative AI is now enhancing each of these stages, offering not just automation but "augmentation" of human capabilities.

:::tip[How AI Can Help]
Generative AI is revolutionizing the SDLC by:

- **Reducing Overhead:** automating documentation and repetitive tasks.
- **Predicting Issues:** using historical data to foresee risks in planning or deployment.
- **Accelerating Creation:** generating code, tests, and configurations instantly.

As Dr. James Bland from AWS states: _"Generative AI is not just enhancing software development; it’s redefining it."_
