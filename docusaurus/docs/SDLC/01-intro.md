# Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle

> [Back to Documentation Intro Contents](../DocumentationIntro.md)

The **<Tooltip text="Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)" definition="A structured process that defines how software is planned, built, tested, and maintained." />** is a structured methodology used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software to complete within time and cost estimates.

## The Phases

The classical SDLC typically follows a series of distinct phases. Each phase relies on the information from the previous phase to produce its own deliverables.

1.  **[Planning and Design](./02-planning-and-design.md):** Gathering requirements and architecting the solution.
2.  **[Code](./03-code.md):** The actionable part where developers write the software.
3.  **[Verify](./04-verify.md):** Testing the software to ensure it solves the problem and is bug-free.
4.  **[Integrate](./05-integrate.md):** Combining modules and managing dependencies.
5.  **[Release](./06-release.md):** Packaging and preparing the software for delivery.
6.  **[Deploy](./07-deploy.md):** Moving the software to production environments.
7.  **[Operate](./08-operate.md):** Running the software in the real world.
8.  **[Monitor](./09-monitor.md):** Observing system health and user behavior.

## The Evolution to AI

While the core principles of SDLC remain constant, the tools and methodologies are evolving. Generative AI is now enhancing each of these stages, offering not just automation but <Tooltip text="augmentation" definition="Using AI to extend and enhance human capabilities rather than replace them." /> of human capabilities.

:::tip[How AI Can Help]
Generative AI is revolutionizing the SDLC by:

- **Reducing Overhead:** Automating documentation and repetitive tasks.
- **Predicting Issues:** Using historical data to foresee risks in planning or deployment.
- **Accelerating Creation:** Generating code, tests, and configurations near-instantly.
