# Operate

> [Back to SDLC Intro](../SDLC/introduction)

The **Operate** phase involves the day-to-day running of the software. This is where the value is delivered to the user.

## Operations & Reliability

The goal is to ensure high availability, reliability, and performance.

- **Capacity Planning:** Ensuring there are enough resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) to handle user load.
- **Incident Management:** Responding to outages or service degradations.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Proactively testing system resilience by simulating failures.
- **Security Operations (SecOps):** Defending against active threats.

### Key Deliverables

- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) Reports
- Incident Reports
- Operational Runbooks

:::tip[How AI Can Help: Operations]
AI is critical for managing the complexity of modern distributed systems:

- **Self-Healing:** AI enables systems to recover automatically by rerouting traffic or faster scaling. [Cisco AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/) uses AI to minimize downtime.
- **Intelligent Incidence Response:** [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) uses ML to automate incident triage and improve alert routing.
- **Security:** [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) use AI to detect and block threats in real-time.
