# Planning and Design

> [Back to Documentation Intro Contents](../DocumentationIntro.md)

The **Planning** and **Design** phases are the foundational pillars of the SDLC. Mistakes made here are often the most expensive to fix later in the cycle.

## Planning Phase

**Planning** involves defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. It starts with requirement gathering—understanding exactly what the stakeholders need.

- **Feasibility Study:** Can we build it? (Technical, Economic, Legal check).
- **Requirement Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of features (Functional and Non-functional).
- **Project Scheduling:** Estimating timelines, resources, and costs (often using Agile methodologies).

### Key Deliverables

- Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
- Project Plan / Roadmap
- Risk Management Plan

Global AI tools are streamlining the planning process:

- **Meeting Automation:** Tools can transcribe and summarize meetings, extracting action items automatically.
- **Agile Enhancements:** In Agile, AI analyzes historical data to predict sprint velocities and suggest optimal backlogs.
- **Tool Spotlight:** [Atlassian Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) uses AI to help teams make data-driven decisions in planning.

## Design Phase

Once requirements are clear, the **Design** phase translates them into a blueprint for construction. This includes both high-level architecture and low-level component design.

- **System Architecture:** Defining the high-level structure (Monolith vs Microservices, Cloud vs On-prem).
- **Data Design:** Database schemas and data flow diagrams.
- **UI/UX Design:** Wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for the user interface.

### Key Deliverables

- Design Document (High-Level and Low-Level)
- Database Schema
- UI Mockups/Prototypes

AI is accelerating the transition from concept to blueprint:

- **Generative UI:** AI can generate initial UI/UX mockups from text requirements (e.g., [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) with WireGen).
- **Architectural Advice:** AI tools can analyze requirements to suggest optimal system architectures and even creates preliminary code structures.
- **Documentation Analysis:** AI can analyze voice transcripts or lengthy discussions on platforms like [Harness](https://harness.io/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to extract key design decisions.
