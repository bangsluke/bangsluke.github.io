## PWA Installation

The PWA Installation section provides options for installing the Dorkinians Website as a Progressive Web App on your device. This is highly recommended to do so as it provides a more native, app-like experience compared to using it in a browser.

### <Tooltip text="Install prompt" definition="The browser or app dialog that asks the user if they want to add the PWA to their home screen or device." /> {#install-prompt}

The install prompt appears when:

- The app detects that it can be installed on your device
- You haven't already installed the app
- Your browser supports PWA installation

**To Install:**

1. Tap the "Install App" button
2. Follow your device's installation prompts
3. The app will be added to your home screen or app drawer

:::info
PWA installation is supported on most modern mobile browsers and some desktop browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
