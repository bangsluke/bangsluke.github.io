## Chatbot Interface

The chatbot interface is the primary way to interact with the app. You can ask questions about any aspect of Dorkinians FC statistics and receive instant answers with visual data.

### Asking Questions

To ask a question, simply type it into the chatbot input field and press Enter or tap the send button. The chatbot understands natural language, so you can ask questions in various ways:

- "How many goals has Luke Bangs scored?"
- "Show me the top goal scorers this season"
- "What's the 1st team's win percentage?"
- "Who has the most appearances for the club?"

:::tip
The chatbot understands typos and variations in player names, team names, and stat types. For example, "Luk Bangs" will be matched to "Luke Bangs".
:::

The chatbot processes your question and returns:
- A natural language answer
- Visual data (charts, tables, or number cards)
- Source information showing where the data came from

### Player Context

You can set a player context that the chatbot will use when answering questions. When a player is selected, you can use pronouns like "I", "me", or "my" in your questions, and the chatbot will automatically apply them to the selected player.

**Setting Player Context:**
1. Navigate to the Stats page
2. Select a player using the player selector
3. Return to the Home page
4. Ask questions using "I", "me", or "my" (e.g., "How many goals have I scored?")

:::info
Player context persists across sessions, so you don't need to reselect your player every time you use the app.
:::

**Clearing Player Context:**
- Navigate to the Stats page
- Click the edit button to enter edit mode
- Clear the player selection

### Example Questions

The chatbot interface includes example questions that you can click to quickly ask common queries. These examples demonstrate the types of questions the chatbot can answer:

- Player statistics questions
- Team performance queries
- Club-wide statistics
- Comparison questions
- Historical data queries

Clicking an example question will automatically populate the input field, and you can modify it or submit it as-is.

:::tip
Use example questions as templates for your own queries - they show the best way to phrase questions for accurate results.

### Conversation History

The chatbot maintains a conversation history during your session. Previous questions and answers are displayed above the input field, allowing you to:

- Review previous queries and responses
- See the context of your conversation
- Reference earlier answers

Conversation history is stored locally in your browser and persists across page refreshes within the same session.

:::info
Conversation history helps the chatbot understand context for follow-up questions, making your interactions more natural.

- **Line Charts**: Trends over time
- **Tables**: Detailed data listings
- **Radar Charts**: Multi-dimensional player comparisons

Visualizations are interactive and responsive, adapting to your device screen size.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Be Specific**: More specific questions yield better results. Instead of "goals", try "goals this season" or "goals for the 1st team"

2. **Use Filters in Stats**: For detailed analysis, use the Stats page with filters rather than the chatbot

3. **Combine Questions**: Ask follow-up questions that build on previous answers for deeper insights

4. **Check Visualizations**: Always review the visual responses - they often reveal patterns not obvious in text answers

5. **Player Context**: Set your player context once, then use pronouns in questions for faster queries

:::warning
The chatbot works best with questions about existing data. It cannot predict future performance or provide opinions.
