## Tips and Tricks

1. **Use Filters Strategically**: Apply filters to focus on specific aspects of performance (e.g., "this season", "home matches only")

2. **Compare Across Sections**: Use the same filters across Player Stats, Team Stats, and Club Stats to see how individual performance relates to team and club performance

3. **Explore Data Tables**: When you need exact values or want to see all available statistics, check the Data Table sections

4. **Check Multiple Sections**: Some statistics appear in multiple sections with different visualizations - explore different sections to find the view that works best for you

5. **Use Comparison for Insights**: The Comparison section is great for identifying strengths and weaknesses when evaluating players

6. **Player Context**: Set a player context in Player Stats, then use the chatbot on the Home page with pronouns for quick queries

:::warning
Filters persist when navigating between Stats sub-pages, so remember to clear filters if you want to see unfiltered data in a different section.
