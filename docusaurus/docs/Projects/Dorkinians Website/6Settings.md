## Database Status

The Database Status section displays information about the app's database connection and data seeding status.

### Seeding Status

The seeding status indicates whether the database has been successfully populated with the latest statistics data:

- **Success**: Database has been successfully seeded with the latest data
- **Failed**: Database seeding encountered an error
- **Running**: Database seeding is currently in progress
- **Unknown**: Seeding status is not available

:::info
Database seeding is the process of loading statistics data into the database. This typically happens automatically but may need to be triggered manually in some cases.

- **Gray Clock**: Status is unknown or not available

The status indicator is accompanied by a text summary explaining the current state.

- **Relationships Created**: Number of relationships between data entries created
- **Last Seeding Time**: When the database was last successfully seeded

This information helps verify that the database contains the expected amount of data.
