## Switching Package Managers

### From NPM to Yarn

- Install yarn using `npm i -g yarn` if not already installed
- Go to the directory where you install packages and run the `yarn` command
- Yarn will init and create its `yarn.lock` file
- Now delete `package-lock.json` `*Note`
- In your `package.json` file replace all npm commands with yarn in "scripts"
- Run `yarn dev` or whatever command you use for running a yarn script

> `*Note`: It is important you don't delete it before yarn command (as some people suggest) it can break things, for example your yarn command will not even work and it will throw error:
`Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './package-lock.json'`

### From Yarn to PNPM

Migrating from yarn to pnpm is quite straightforward:

- Install pnpm `npm install -g pnpm` if not already installed
- Rename all your yarn commands to pnpm:
	- `yarn` -> `pnpm install`
	- `yarn test` -> `pnpm test`
	- `yarn package` -> `pnpm package`
	- `yarn deploy` -> `pnpm run deploy` (**run** is required here, as `pnpm deploy` is a reserved command)
- Replace all occurrences of the string `yarn.lock` in your source files with `pnpm-lock.yaml` (search, prettier, etc.)
- In your CI/CD, when using `actions/setup-node@v3`, set `cache` to `'pnpm'`
- If you're using yarn PnP, remove `.yarnrc.yml` and the `.yarn` folder
- In the root `package.json` set the packageManager key to `pnpm@<version>` (replace `<version>` with the latest available version)
- Create a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file with:

	```yaml
	packages:
	- 'services/*'
	- 'contracts/*'
	- 'packages/*'
	```

	and everything that is in the `workspaces` key of the root `package.json`
- Run `pnpm import` to generate a `pnpm-lock.yaml` from your `yarn.lock`, then remove `yarn.lock`
- Run `pnpm install`
