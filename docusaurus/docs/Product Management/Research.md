## Accelerate

> By Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim

### Accelerate Summary

Accelerate explores what makes top engineering organisations deliver software quickly and reliably, using several years of rigorous DevOps research. The authors show that high performance isn’t about heroics or rigid processes, but about adopting proven technical practices and building a supportive, learning‑focused culture. A major contribution is the [DORA metrics](../product-management/product-management-intro#dora-metrics), which give teams a clear way to measure delivery speed and stability. The book highlights how practices like continuous delivery, automation, trunk‑based development, and psychological safety consistently improve outcomes. Overall, it’s a concise, evidence‑backed guide to creating teams that ship faster, break less, and drive real business impact.

### Accelerate Key Concepts

Other than the [DORA metrics](../product-management/product-management-intro#dora-metrics), the key concepts in Accelerate include uncovering 24 key capabilities that drive software delivery performance (listed in Appendix A), which are grouped into five categories and all listed below:

**Continuous Delivery Capabilities:**

1. Use version control for all production artifacts
2. Automate your deployment process
3. Implement continuous integration
4. Use trunk-based development
5. Implement test automation
6. Support test data management
7. Shift left on security
8. Implement continuous delivery (CD)

**Architecture Capabilities:**

9. Use a loosely coupled architecture
10. Architect for empowered teams

**Product and Process Capabilities:**

11. Gather and implement customer feedback
12. Make the flow of work visible through the value stream
13. Work in small batches
14. Foster and enable team experimentation

**Lean Management and Monitoring Capabilities:**

15. Have a lightweight change approval process
16. Monitor acrosss application and infrastructure to inform business decisions
17. Check system health proactively
18. Identify processes and manage work with work-in-process (WIP) limits
19. Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team

**Cultural Capabilities:**

20. Support a generative culture (as outlined by Westrum)
21. Encourage and support learning. Is learning, in your culture, considered essential for continued progress?
22. Support and facilitiate collaboration amoung teams
23. Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful
24. Support or embody transformational leadership
