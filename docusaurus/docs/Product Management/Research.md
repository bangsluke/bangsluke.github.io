## Accelerate

> By Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim

### Accelerate Summary

Accelerate explores what makes top engineering organisations deliver software quickly and reliably, using several years of rigorous DevOps research. The authors show that high performance isn’t about heroics or rigid processes, but about adopting proven technical practices and building a supportive, learning‑focused culture. A major contribution is the [DORA metrics](../product-management/product-management-intro#dora-metrics), which give teams a clear way to measure delivery speed and stability. The book highlights how practices like <Tooltip text="continuous delivery (CD)" definition="Releasing software in a way that allows frequent, reliable deployments to production at any time." />, automation, <Tooltip text="trunk-based development" definition="A branching strategy where developers integrate small, frequent changes into a single main branch (trunk)." />, and <Tooltip text="psychological safety" definition="A team culture where people feel safe to take risks, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of blame." /> consistently improve outcomes. Overall, it’s a concise, evidence‑backed guide to creating teams that ship faster, break less, and drive real business impact.

### Accelerate Key Concepts

Other than the [DORA metrics](../product-management/product-management-intro#dora-metrics), the key concepts in Accelerate include uncovering 24 key capabilities that drive software delivery performance (listed in Appendix A), which are grouped into five categories and all listed below:

**Continuous Delivery Capabilities:**

1. Use version control for all production artifacts
2. Automate your deployment process
3. Implement continuous integration
4. Use trunk-based development
5. Implement test automation
6. Support test data management
7. Shift left on security
8. Implement continuous delivery (CD)

**Architecture Capabilities:**

9. Use a loosely coupled architecture
10. Architect for empowered teams

**Product and Process Capabilities:**

11. Gather and implement customer feedback
12. Make the flow of work visible through the <Tooltip text="value stream" definition="The end-to-end flow of work from idea or request to delivery to the user." />
13. Work in small batches
14. Foster and enable team experimentation

**Lean Management and Monitoring Capabilities:**

15. Have a lightweight change approval process
16. Monitor acrosss application and infrastructure to inform business decisions
17. Check system health proactively
18. Identify processes and manage work with <Tooltip text="WIP limits" definition="Work-in-process limits: caps on how many items can be in progress at once to reduce overload and improve flow." />
19. Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team

**Cultural Capabilities:**

20. Support a generative culture (as outlined by Westrum)
21. Encourage and support learning. Is learning, in your culture, considered essential for continued progress?
22. Support and facilitiate collaboration amoung teams
23. Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful
24. Support or embody transformational leadership

#### The Three Ways (The Phoenix Project)

- **The First Way (Flow)**: Focus on the left-to-right flow of work from Development to Operations. It’s about making work visible, limiting WIP (Work in Progress), and reducing bottlenecks (like Brent!).
- **The Second Way (Feedback)**: This is about creating fast feedback loops from right to left. If something breaks in production, Dev needs to know now, not in three weeks.
- **The Third Way (Continual Learning)**: Building a culture that values experimentation, taking risks, and learning from failure so the whole system gets smarter over time.
