# Docusaurus 3.x Patterns

## Documentation Structure

### Frontmatter

Always include frontmatter for docs when needed:

```md
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: Page Title
description: Brief description for SEO
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

### Category Configuration

Each folder should have `_category_.json`:

```json
{
  "label": "Category Name",
  "position": 1,
  "collapsed": false,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "Category description"
  }
}
```

---

## MDX Components

### Using React Components in MDX

```mdx
import MyComponent from "@site/src/components/MyComponent";

<MyComponent prop="value" />
```

### Admonitions

Use built-in admonitions for callouts:

```md
:::note
This is a note
:::

:::tip
This is a tip
:::

:::warning
This is a warning
:::

:::danger
This is dangerous
:::

:::info
This is info
:::
```

### Code Blocks

Always specify language and optionally title:

````md
```javascript title="example.js"
const example = "code";
```
````

````

---

## Configuration Patterns

### docusaurus.config.js
- Keep configuration organized by section
- Use JSDoc type annotations for IDE support
- Extract complex configs into separate variables

### Sidebar Configuration
- Use `autogenerated` for simple structures
- Use explicit sidebar items for custom ordering
- Keep sidebar depth reasonable (max 3-4 levels)

---

## PWA Considerations

This project uses `@docusaurus/plugin-pwa`:
- Test offline functionality after major changes
- Update `manifest.json` if branding changes
- Icons must be in `/static/img/`

---

## Algolia Search

Search is configured via DocSearch:
- Ensure headings are descriptive for search
- Use consistent terminology across docs
- Avoid duplicate content that confuses search

---

## Best Practices

1. **One topic per page**: Keep docs focused
2. **Use consistent headings**: Follow h1 > h2 > h3 hierarchy
3. **Include examples**: Code examples improve comprehension
4. **Link related docs**: Use internal links liberally
5. **Keep URLs stable**: Avoid renaming files unnecessarily
6. **Test locally**: Run `yarn start` before committing

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Serve production build locally
yarn serve

# Clear cache if issues occur
yarn clear
````
