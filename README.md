## HTML & CSS

### HTML

#### HTML Best Coding Practice

##### HTML Classes
- To assign an element multiple classes, separate the classes with a space. E.g. class="feature-box sales" would apply the style rules from class "feature-box" and also "sales".

##### HTML Comments
- In HTML a comment is within the following characters: <! text >

### CSS

#### CSS Best Coding Practice

##### CSS Variables
 - In CSS, a variable can be defined as "--accent-color-purple: #8F23FF" and then used later on by assigning a property the value of "var(--accent-color-purple, white)" where  the value after the common is in case the variable isn't available.
##### CSS Classes & Selectors
- Remember that attributes started with .attribute are for classes, and attributes started with #attribute are for ids
- "The difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element." Use classes wherever possible and try to avoid ids in the most case. For details on class vs ids see here: https://careerkarma.com/blog/css-class-vs-id-2/
- Or selector (,): Select elements that match any selector in the list. If you separate CSS classes with commas, your rules are applied to all the class in the list. E.g. section, div { would mean apply all rules to section elements and div elements.
- And selector (.): Select elements that match all the selector combinations. If you separate CSS classes with full stops, your rules are applied slightly different. E.g. section.feature-box { would mean you're apply the rules to all section elements that have the class "feature-box".
- Descendant selector ( ): Select elements that are direct children of the first element. If you separate CSS classes with ">", your rules are applied differently again. E.g. div > a { would mean you're apply the rules to all anchors that are direct children of a div element.
- Direct Child (>): Select elements that are descendants of the first element. If you separate CSS classes with spaces, your rules are applied differently again. E.g. section div { would mean you're apply the rules to all div elements that are structured under a section.
- :root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html element. By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from any other selector in the style sheet.
##### CSS Comments
- In CSS a comment is within the following characters: /* text */
##### Key CSS Notes
- Design for Mobile size first! Then scale up.
- Remember that for margins and padding, it goes (top, right, bottom and left).

## JavaScript

### JavaScript Best Coding Practice

#### JavaScript Functions and Variables
- Use camelCase for defining functions and variables, e.g. “firstName”.
#### JavaScript Constants
- Use capitals and underscores for constants, e.g. “CONSTANT” or “CONSTANT_NAME”.
#### JavaScript Comments
- Use // for comments.
#### JavaScript Messages
- Use alert() to ensure that information gets through to a user. When an alert box pops up, the user must click OK to proceed. Alert takes a single string parameter of text to display.
- Use var x = prompt() to have the user input a value and press OK or Cancel. OK returns the input value, Cancel returns null. Prompt takes two parameters; a string label to display and an optional string to display in the input box.
- Use var x = confirm() to have the user provide a boolean result from an OK or Cancel button. Confirm returns true if the user selected OK, or false if they selected Cancel. Confirm takes a single string parameter of text to display.
